# Goals

1. To provide an interface for administrators to browse system settings that are recorded in docklet.conf and container.conf.  
2. To enable administrators to modify parameters that will take effect immediately.

# Design

1. Add a table to the original Admin page to display system settings.
2. Provide a button for every parameter to view the detailed comments.
3. Provide a button for every aprameter that can be modified to modify it.
4. Display default value and historical values for every parameter.
5. Set these default and historical values clickable to reuse them.
6. For container.conf, add a text field to show its complete content.
